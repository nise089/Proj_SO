                        In the <b>founding phase</b>, the owner receives an endowment of {{C.ENDOWMENT}} and can decide
                        to keep it or to invest it as a loan to start the company.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If the money is kept, Part 2 ends. The owner receives the endowment, and the workers
                            receive no payoff.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the endowment is invested, Part 2 continues with the production phase. The investment is
                            treated as a loan to the company. It will be repaid after the first round of the production
                            phase.

                    The <b>production phase</b> has a maximum of {{C.ROUNDS}} rounds. <br>
                    Each round of the production phase has three consecutive stages:
                     <b>a. working stage, b. profit choice stage</b>, and <b>c. selling stage</b>.<br>
                     <ol type="a">
                        <li>In the <b>working stage</b>, each worker performs a task, generating company profit.</li>
                        <li>In the <b>profit choice stage</b>, the owner decides how the profit is spent. </li>
                        <li>Finally, in the <b>selling choice stage</b>, the owner can decide whether to sell the company
                            or not.
                            <ul>

                                    If the company is sold, the experiment ends, and each participant receives the payoff
                                    collected until this round.
                                </li>

                                    If the company is not sold, the experiment continues with the next round until the last
                                    round or until the company is sold.
